# Introduction
Application to display near-by electric vehicles charging spots.

# Packages 
1. data -  It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. domain - Here ViewModel holding data for UI.
3. ui - It has MainActivity which shows data collected from ViewModel.
4. di - separating the creation of an object from its usage 
        to decreased coupling between classes and their dependencies.

# Feature
1. Display a list of the near-by charging spots based on the userâ€™s current location.
2. Display address information.
3. The list have a minimum thumbnail view.
4. Have a setting menu to display maximum results of near-by charging spots.
5. Here is what the UI looks like ->

# Overview
  1. LiveData - To updates app component MainActivity from ViewModel.
  2. Coroutine - To perform background operation
  3. Retrofit - For API call
  4. Gson - To parse json string to object 
 

# Architecture
Used Google MVVM architecture.
  1. MVVM with ViewModel and Repository to avoid logical code in Activity.
  2. Loose coupling by making code dependent on interfaces rather than implementations
     eg:  ElectricChargeSpotRepository

# Possible Improvement
  1. Caching the charging spots info in the local db 
     and syncing it for user experience.
  2. Add unit test and ui tests
